Bike jumping game

A big thing with the game that I wanted to do for fun was only have one loop (The draw loop)
This means that the majority of the game is made with IF statments and Booleans.

There are a few parts of the code that never got sorted out but what is working is as follows

Start screen

Scoreing system

Bike jumping

Fire moving

Not working

Speed increase

Number of flames increase
